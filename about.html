      <h2> The Problem </h2> 
      <p> A May 2020 study from the U.S. Census Bureau found that more than 1/3 of Americans are experiencing symptoms of clinical anxiety or depression. However, not all individuals have the same level of psychological stress. Among those hardest hit by this unfolding mental health crisis are healthcare workers. For example, a study out of 1,257 workers in China in March 2020 reported that <b> 72% of workers were experiencing distress, 44.6% were experiencing anxiety, and 34.0% were experiencing insomnia </b> (JAMA Network). </b> 
      <p> Why are healthcare workers particularly affected? <ul>
          <li> They are working in a stressful, fast-paced environment (hospital/ambulance) for a prolonged period of time. This puts them at risk for <b> burnout </b>, especially when they must work <b> without proper PPE. </b>
          <li> They are at a <b> higher risk of getting COVID-19. </b>
          <li> They must often <b> live away from their families </b> to avoid spreading the virus. 
          <li> They must cope with the frequent occurrence of a patient's death. 
          <li> Due to the amount of schooling and long work hours, healthcare workers are <b> already at higher risk for developing mental health issues than the average person. </b>  
          </ul> 
      </p>
      <h2> The Solution </h2> 
      <p> PsychBase.doc is a revolutionary new platform for healthcare workers to find and share helpful mental health resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. Modeled after Pinterest, this anonymous, open-access database helps our #HealthcareHeroes obtain the support and psychological tools they need to deal with the stress their jobs can induce. 
        
        is divided into six "resource boards" to help healthcare workers cope and support each other. A user can click on
